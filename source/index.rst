Syncany User Guide
==================
Syncany is an open-source cloud storage and filesharing application. It allows
users to backup and share certain folders of their workstations using any kind
of storage, e.g. FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3 and Samba.

While the basic idea is similar to Dropbox, Syncany is
open-source and additionally provides data encryption and more flexibility in
terms of storage type and provider:

- **Data encryption**: Syncany encrypts the files locally, so that any online
  storage can be used even for sensitive data.  
- **Any storage**: Syncany uses a plug-in based storage system. It can
  be used with any type of remote storage.
