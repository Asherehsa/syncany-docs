What is Syncany?
================

Syncany is not a file sync tool. Not really anyway. It's not a versioning tool either. Not a real one anyway. And it's also not a backup tool. It's sort of all of them combined. With encryption. Confused yet? Let me explain. Syncany solves a very particular need: A group of users want to share files in a Dropbox-like continuous-sync fashion. They have some storage lying around -- say an FTP folder or a Samba share -- but they don't trust the storage provider with their data. 

This is where Syncany comes in: With normal syncing tools, you are either bound to a provider, bound to a certain type of storage/protocol or you have to trust the underlying storage provider. Syncany is incredibly flexible in terms of storage and provides client-side encryption out-of-the-box and enabled by default. And to top it all of, it offers smart file versioning and storage space reduction techniques through data deduplication. To sum this all up: **Syncany is a client-side encrypted, deduplicated, storage-abstracted, multi-client file synchronization software with versioning capabilities**. 

That means it offers:

- Continuous file synchronzation between multiple clients
- Use your own and any type of storage (no installation on the server needed)
- Client-side encryption of data
- Minimal remote storage usage through deduplication
- File versioning on chunk-level

Use Case 1: Friends sharing files 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Pim, Philipp and Steffen want to share a folder. Pim has an FTP account at a random hosting company and can spare some storage space. Since they do not want the hosting company (or any other third parties) to have access to their files, they can use Syncany to turn that FTP folder without having to worry about manually encrypting or versioning their files.
