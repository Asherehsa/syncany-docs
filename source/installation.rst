Installation
============
Syncany is written in pure Java, so it available on a number of platforms. To make the installation process as easy as possible, we've pre-bundled distributables for most major operating systems (a Mac OSX bundle is still missing, see `issue #34 <https://github.com/syncany/syncany/issues/34>`_). Whenever we release a new version of Syncany, we regenerate these bundles and publish them on the `distribution site <https://www.syncany.org/dist>`_.

On that site, you can find **releases** and **snapshots**. Releases are built and published in a certain release cycle (currently: 2 weeks), and snapshots are built with every commit. Feel free to try out both, but be aware that snapshots are very volatile and things might break without warning.
