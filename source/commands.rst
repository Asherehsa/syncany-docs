Command Line Client
===================
The Syncany command line client (CLI) comes with two main commands: ``sy`` (or: ``syncany``) and ``syd`` (or ``syncanyd``). The ``sy`` command is the central tool to perform all of the Syncany actions, e.g. creating a new managed folder, syncing files, or restoring them. The ``syd`` tool offers a way start and stop the Syncany user daemon, which will then run Syncany in the background.
